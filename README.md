# Github Basics Exercise 2

1. Create a new repository locally on your machine. Called it **myprojectclass26**
2. Create a new Github repository. Name it **myprojectclass26**.
3. Connect your local repo to the Github repo.
4. Make a new file called `favorites.txt`  Leave it empty. Make your first commit on the `master` branch.
5. Push up your `master` branch to Github! Make sure you see your empty `favorites.txt` file on Github.
6. Next, create two branches: `foods` and `movies`
7. Switch to the `foods` branch.  Add three (or more) of your favorite foods to the `favorites.txt` file.  Add and commit your changes on the `foods` branch.
8. Switch to the `movies` branch and add three or more of your favorite movies to the `favorites.txt` file.  Add and commit your changes on the movies branch.
9. Push up your `foods` branch to Github. Make sure you see it on Github!
10. Push up your `movies` branch to Github.  Make sure you see it on Github!
11. Merge the `foods` branch into the `main` branch.  Then merge the `movies` branch into the `main` branch.  If necessary, resolve conflicts so that you end up with your favorite foods and favorite movies in the same `favorites.txt` file.
